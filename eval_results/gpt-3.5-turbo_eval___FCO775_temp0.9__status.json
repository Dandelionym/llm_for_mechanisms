They introduced 2-mercaptobenzoimidazole-5-carboxylic acid (MBIA) as a ligand and used Hydroquinone (HQ) as a reductant. The incubation was performed at a temperature range of 60\u2013100\u00b0C. If the Au seeds were incubated with MBIA at 60\u00b0C for 2 hours, what was the observed outcome of this specific set of conditions?\n\nGiven options:\nA. No significant change in the Au nanoparticles, maintaining their initial citrate-stabilized state.\nB. Formation of Au\u2013Ag alloy nanoparticles with low purity.\nC. Formation of Au\u2013Ag core-shell nanoparticles with moderate purity.\nD. Formation of Au\u2013Ag Janus nanoparticles with high purity (95.7%), with a single Ag island per Au seed.\n",

Specifically, what were the results when the incubation was conducted at 80\u00b0C and 100\u00b0C for 2 hours?\n\nGiven options:\nA. At 80\u00b0C, the formation of monomers (9.7%), dimers (56%), and trimers (35%) was observed, while at 100\u00b0C, most seeds had 2\u20133 islands.\nB. At 80\u00b0C, the formation of dimers (35%), trimers (56%), and tetramers (9.7%) was observed, while at 100\u00b0C, most seeds had 1\u20133 islands.\nC. At 80\u00b0C, the formation of trimers (9.7%), tetramers (56%), and pentamers (35%) was observed, while at 100\u00b0C, most seeds had 7\u20139 islands.\nD. At 80\u00b0C, the formation of dimers (9.7%), trimers (56%), and tetramers (35%) was observed, while at 100\u00b0C, most seeds had 4\u20136 islands.\n",
