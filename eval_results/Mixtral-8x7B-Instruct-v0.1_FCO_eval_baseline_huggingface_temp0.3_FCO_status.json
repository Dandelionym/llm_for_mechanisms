The synthesis was conducted using gold salt, cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB), ascorbic acid (AA), and Cys (both L-Cysteine and D-Cysteine) under varying conditions. What was the observed effect on the chiral optical activity when high concentrations of CTAB were applied in the reaction mixture?\n\nGiven options:\nA. The g-factor decreased, indicating a reduction in chiral optical activity because high CTAB concentrations resulted in greater separation between chiral edges of nanoparticles.\nB. The g-factor remained unchanged, suggesting that CTAB concentration does not affect the chiral optical activity of the nanoparticles.\nC. The g-factor decreased, but this was attributed to the transformation of the cuboctahedron seeds into nanoparticles with non-specific low-index facets.\nD. The g-factor increased, indicating an enhancement in chiral optical activity due to closer proximity between chiral edges of nanoparticles.\n",
